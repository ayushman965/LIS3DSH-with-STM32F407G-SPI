# LIS3DSH-with-STM32F407G-SPI
*This project uses LIS3DSH with STM32F407G microcontroller to get Accelerometer Data on X, Y &amp; Z axis. 
*It also has some fun examples to play with.
*I have used STM32F407G-DISC1 Devkit to run this project.
*The LIS3DSH is mounted on the STM32F407G-DISC1 Devkit. By default, the sesor is connected with STM32F407G microcontroller via SPI pins.
*The LIS3DSH can be communicated with I2C & SPI communication protocol. 
*I have used SPI to communicate with it.
*The repo consist LIS3DSH_Lib.h and LIS3DSH_Lib.c files, which consist all the LIS3DSH sensor related code.
*I have used STM32 Cube MX to initialize the controller. This project uses HAL libraries from ST Microelectronics.
